                      <p>What's up? My name is Elijah. I'm a first-year Games and Simulation student, and my main part in creating this website was constructing the Information page and helping to format all the others (Flexboxes are a godsend!).<br><br>
Since arriving on campus, I've had many exciting experiences, and I've really been enjoying my classes, even though they challenge me quite often.
I both enjoyed and dreaded the website creation process. It was really hard to get going, but once I had a template, I was able to get a workflow going, and I'm (somewhat) proud of what I was able to produce.<br><br>
Outside of academics, I'm quite fond of photography, the occasional long-form hike, playing an absurd amount of board games, and writing unnecessarily long introductions.</p>
