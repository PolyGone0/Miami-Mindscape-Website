                    <div class="descr">
                    VR, or Virtual Reality, is a computer simulated environment that allows users to move in and interact with <br>different virtual objects through the use of controllers or hand tracking. Users can experience many different<br> simulations and even program their own. Through the use of a headset with two screens in front of the eyes,<br> users can see the simulation as if they were actively standing in it, making it feel like you’re truly immersed in <br>the virtual world.

                    <div class="descr">
                        VR and AR are similar, yet very different. AR, meaning Augmented Reality, uses only small virtual elements to enhance the user's experiences, allowing them to interact with both real and virtual objects. A good example of AR is the Apple Vision Pro. While it looks like a standard VR headset, it has a clear front display and projectors built in that display virtual menus onto the glass, allowing users to see both the real world and virtual objects

                    <div class="descr">
                        There are a fair amount of safety and/or health concerns with VR. The most prominent one being physical harm. When you can’t see your surroundings in the real world, you’re bound to hit something. Other concerns are eye strain and motion sickness, as well as more psychological risks like stress or fear that could be caused by certain simulations.

                    <div class="descr">
                        Not at all. VR has many applications outside of the video game industry. Many hospitals use virtual reality to train staff, as well as help patients relax. It’s also used in the automotive industry to build engines in VR so you can learn how they work. Many different industries use virtual reality in order to either accelerate their processes, or to do things that previously weren’t possible.<br><br>

                    <div class="descr">
                        There are many different benefits to VR. They range from improved collaboration and learning, to more cost effective methods and higher training retention. Its most effective field is in training people to do complicated or expensive tasks, where they can simulate different scenarios for far less money in a virtual space instead of the real world.
